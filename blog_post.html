                    Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.<br />
                    The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and
                    take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.<br />
                    <br />
                    A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans.<br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The beginnings of modern AI can be traced to classical philosophers' attempts to describe human thinking as a symbolic system. But the field of AI wasn't formally founded until 1956, at a conference at Dartmouth College,
                    in Hanover, New Hampshire, where the term "artificial intelligence" was coined. MIT cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky and others who attended the conference were extremely optimistic about AI's future. "Within a
                    generation [...] the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved," Minsky is quoted as saying in the book "AI: The Tumultuous Search for Artificial Intelligence" (Basic Books, 1994). <br />
                    <br />
                    But achieving an artificially intelligent being wasn't so simple. After several reports criticizing progress in AI, government funding and interest in the field dropped off – a period from 1974–80 that became known as
                    the "AI winter." The field later revived in the 1980s when the British government started funding it again in part to compete with efforts by the Japanese.
